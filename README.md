# Vision Transformer (ViT) from Scratch

## Project Description
This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using PyTorch. The Vision Transformer is a model for image classification that uses the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, applied to image patches.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- DeepSpeed (optional, for memory optimization)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended)

### Installation
Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision deepspeed
